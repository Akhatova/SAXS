# SAXS
Here you can find a python script for data treatment of SAXS integrated intensity across the weld.
Please open "SAXS analysis step by step.ipynb".

The script include:
1. Brief theory
2. SAXS intensity profile analysis
3. EPMA concentration profile analysis
4. Table with experimental and calculated values of M23C6 lattice parameter
5. Calculation of matrix lattice parameter based on:
a) A.J. Bradley, The lattice spacing of iron-nickel alloys
b) A.Beskrovni, Effect of Cr content on the crystal structure and lattice dynamics of FCC Fe–Cr–Ni–N austenitic alloys
6.
